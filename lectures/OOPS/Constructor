Constructor

a) Constructor is a special method which is called automatically at the time of object creation.
b) It is used to initialize the data members of new objects genrally.
  1. Constructor have a same same as class name
  2. Constructor doesn't have return type
  3. Constructor only called once at the time of object creation.


There are three types of constructor

a). Non-Parameterized constructor:- A constructor which has no argument is known as non-parameterized constructor.
2. If we don't create then it is created by default.
3. It is invoked at the time of creating an object.

    class Person {
       String name;
       int age;
       Person() {    //Non-Parametrized constructor
         System.out.println("Constructor called");
                }
             }

b) Parameterized Constructor:-
      1. Constructor which has parameter is called as parameterized constructor.
      2. It is used to provide different value to distinct objects.

       class Person {
              String name;
              int age;
              Person(String name, int age) {    //Parametrized constructor
                   this.name=name;
                   this.age=age;
                       }
             }

c) Copy Constructor:-

     1. A copy Constructor is an overloaded constructor used to declare and initialize an object from another object

           class Person {
                 String name;
                 int age;
                 Person(Person p2) {    //Parametrized constructor
                   this.name= p2.name;
                   this.age= p2.age
                     }
                }
