1. Variable is container in which value can be stored.
2. There are three types of variables

2.a) Local Variable
2.b) Class Instance Variable
2.c) Reference variable


Local Variable :- Local Variable is variable which is defined inside the method(sum()) and the scope of the variable within the method only. e.g s1, s2, m1, m2

int s1 = 10;

int:- is DataType
s1:- variable name
10:- value

Class reference variable :- The variable which is defined at class reference level and all the methods can access this variable.

Instance Variable:- The variable in which newly object created stored is called as Instance Variable

Pen p1 = new Pen();

p1 is instance variable



example:- if int s1 is defined under sum() method

public class HelloWorld {

   int refVariable; //class reference variable

    public static void main(String args[]) {

        System.out.println("My First Program");

        multiply();
    }

    public static void sum() {
        int s1=30; //local variable
        int s2=60; //local variable
        int sum;
        sum=s1+s2;
        System.out.println(sum);
    }

    public static void multiply(){
        int m1=30;
        int m2=60;
        int multiply;
        multiply=s1*s2;
        System.out.println(multiply);

        sum();


    }

}
