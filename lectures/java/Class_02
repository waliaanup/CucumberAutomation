1. Java is a programming language and a platform.
2. Any hardware and software environment in which program runs is known as platform.

   Features of Java

1. Platform Independent :- When Java program runs, the java compiler create the bytecode(.class file). JVM execute this byte code and run the program.

    HelloWorld.java -----javac ---HelloWorld.class(bytecode)------JVM-----mac, windows, safari.

javac compiling the HelloWorld.java class and generate teh byte code. Now JVM runs this byte code in different operating system.


2. Secured :- Java provides the security using the String class.

3. Object Oriented :- Everything in java is in form of object.


---------------------------JVM/JRE/JDK----------------------------------

JVM :- a) JVM is java virtual machine which doesn't physical exist.4
b) It provides the environment in which byte code gets execute.


JRE :- JRE is Java Runtime environment which has all the libraries of java.

JDK : a) JDK is a java development kit
b) JDK = JVM + JRE

-------------------------Data Types-----------------------

There are two types of Data Types

1. Primitive Data Types
2. Non Primitive Data Types


1. Primitive Data Types :-
a) Primitive data types specify the size and type of variable values.
b) There are 8 types of Primitive data types in Java â€“ Boolean, char, byte, int, short, long, float, and double
