Memory Management

1. Stack :-
a) Stack is memory which works on LIFO(Last in First Out). It means the value which will will assign at last will be removed first.
b) Local variable are stored in stack
c) Methods are stored in stack
d) instance variable are stored in stack i.e p1
  Pen p1 = ne Pen();


2. Heap

a) Class reference variables are stored in Heap memory.
b) When we create an object, the object is stored in heap. i.e new Pen() will be stored in heap
e.g
   Pen p1 = new Pen();

3. Meta Space

a) All the static Variables are stored in meta space
 i.e static int s1 =20;

b) All the static methods are stored in meta space
i.e public static void sum(){
}

3. SCP

a) SCP is String Constant pool
b) When we create String literals, the it stores in the SCP. i.e "Automation Testing" will be store in SCP
   String literal :- String s1 = "Automation Testing"
    s1 will store in stack
c) When we create a new String literal with different variable name s3 and having same value, then it will not create new object in SCP.

    String s2 = "Automation Testing"

    s2 will point to the existing object "Automation Testing" in SCP
